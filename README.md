# Minimizing Row Removal to Achieve Desired Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in Datasets

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on developing and implementing algorithms to minimize the removal of rows in datasets to achieve a specified Average Treatment Effect (ATE). The primary goal is to adjust the ATE with minimal data loss while accounting for potential confounders. The project includes:

- **Algorithm Development:** Implementation of various algorithms including Greedy Combined Algorithm, Naive Removal Algorithm, Binary Search Removal Algorithm, and Per Group Removal Algorithm.
- **Experiments:** Conducting experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
- **Real-World Application:** Applying the methodologies to a StackOverflow survey dataset to demonstrate practical applicability.


## **Files Included:**
- **Combined.py, OneConfounder.py, MultipleConfounders.py, RealData.py:** Python scripts implementing the various algorithms and conducting experiments.
- **Results/**: Directory containing output files, plots, and logs from experiments.
- **ProjectReport**.pdf: A report detailing the project information and progression.
- **README.md:** Project documentation.
